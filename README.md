# gunnhacks-bot
profanity/moderation bot for gunnhacks 7.0 hackathon
## Inspiration
The inspiration behind this project came from my own Discord server. As a family friendly content creator with over 600 members in my Discord server, it can be tough to moderate the chat. Discord bots make it 100x easier on server owners with automatic moderation abilities. 

## What it does
This Discord bot keeps the chat clean! It removes any messages containing blacklisted words from the server chat. You can customize the blacklist by adding or removing words. You can also purge multiple messages at a time in a chat. 

## How we built it
I built this Discord bot using Python and the PyCharm IDE. I also created a Discord server and used the Discord developer portal to set up the bot. 

## Challenges we ran into
I ran into many problems during this entire hackathon - my first 3 projects all were heavy on the hardware side, but with each project I ran into a dead end and found out that something wasn't compatible. With only 12 hours left on the deadline, I decided to make this Discord bot despite having never coded a bot or used Python before. Because I was used to languages like Java and JavaScript, learning and getting the hang of the Python syntax was my first obstacle. I ran into many errors and problems with the code and worked alone, so a lot of time was spent debugging and learning new things.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I'm proud that I was able to create this product as a result of my first ever attempt with Python and Discord bots. I was able to do much more than I imagined, especially in such a short time frame (and without any sleep!) This was my first hackathon, and despite being heavily discouraged after my first few failed projects, I managed to pull through in the end as a soloist. Though I would've liked to do more with this project, I've already learned so many things and plan to build off of this. I'm glad that this is a project that I can actually build off of and utilize for my own benefit.

## What we learned
Throughout this hackathon, I learned how to program arduinos and work with C++ (my failed projects), and then learned a lot about Python and how to code Discord bots. Everything I did this weekend was pretty much a new experience for me, and while it was risky and daunting, I was able to learn a lot from my failures and struggles. With the unforeseen time crunch, 100% of this bot was being worked with under pressure to meet the deadline. 

## What's next for Swear No More (Profanity Discord Bot)
After this hackathon, I definitely plan to allot more time to the development of this bot and add more moderation features beyond the profanity filter and message purge feature. Currently, the bot is hosted locally on my computer so I would also like to look into hosting it on a domain whenever it has more functionalities. Another big goal of mine for this project would be to set up a customizable web dashboard with features that server owners could easily modify to their liking.
